A book is a set of printed sheets of paper held together between two covers. The sheets of paper are usually covered with a text, language and illustrations. The book is a more flexible format than the earlier idea of the scroll. The change from scrolls to books began in the Roman Empire, and took many centuries to become complete. A writer of a book is called an author. Someone who draws pictures in a book is called an illustrator. Books can have more than one author or illustrator.
